# Apply.io Frontend Technical Assessment

## Introduction
Welcome to the next step of Contra's engineering interview process! You'll be asked to complete a code assessment in the stack we use internally at Contra: Node.JS, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. We've configured sensible repository defaults and boilerplate Frontend and Backend projects, so you can spend your time writing actual code, not configuration.

We know not everyone has experience with our core stack — that's okay! The goal of this exercise is to assess your ability to learn, and make good software design decisions along the way. To be respectful of your time, this assessment is designed to be completed in under 4 hours and has no deadlines or due dates.

If you have any questions, reach out to Anthony at anthony@joinapply.co

## Evaluation
When evaluating your submission, we care about the following:

Correctness
Developer Experience
Tests of any kind, as long as you can explain why you added the tests that you did
Performance & Scaleability
Code consistency, style, and quality
There's no perfect solution — "Developer Experience, "Performance & Scaleability,", and "Code Quality" mean different things in different contexts. Use your best judgement, and explicitly call out any assumptions you made along the way. Remember: there aren't any tricks here, and we review every submission with the best intent.

## Submission
Fork & PR When you're ready, fork this repository and create a Pull Request. In your Pull Request, be sure to clearly explain the changes you made, and any assumptions your reviewer should keep in mind.

## Loom Submission
At Apply, we prize great communication over all else. In addition to great written communication, we love concise Loom demos that capture your personality and passion for your work, and convey what you can't in writing. As part of your submission, attach a <5 minute Loom to your PR description that introduces yourself, walks through your code, and the decisions you made along the way.
